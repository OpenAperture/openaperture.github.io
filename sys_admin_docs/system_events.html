			<h2>What are SystemEvents?</h2>
			<p>SystemEvents are notification events that are generated by all SystemComponents when something abnormal occurs in the system.  SystemEvents may be retrieve with a GET to /system_events.  Currently, events will be generated in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An unhandled exception occurs during the processing of a message in any component</li>
				<li>The Overseer is unable to determine how many nodes are in any cluster associated in the same <a href="https://github.com/OpenAperture/manager/blob/master/lib/manager/db/models/messaging/messaging_exchange.ex">MessagingExchange</a> as the Overseer</li>
				<li>The Overseer finds no available nodes are in any cluster associated in the same <a href="https://github.com/OpenAperture/manager/blob/master/lib/manager/db/models/messaging/messaging_exchange.ex">MessagingExchange</a> as the Overseer</li>			
				<li>The Overseer finds a node in any cluster associated in the same <a href="https://github.com/OpenAperture/manager/blob/master/lib/manager/db/models/messaging/messaging_exchange.ex">MessagingExchange</a> as the Overseer</li> has used more than 80% of the space available in the /var/lib/docker directory.
				<li>The Overseer finds a Fleet Unit instance on any node in any cluster associated in the same <a href="https://github.com/OpenAperture/manager/blob/master/lib/manager/db/models/messaging/messaging_exchange.ex">MessagingExchange</a> as the Overseer</li> which is in a failed state.					
				<li>The Overseer finds a Fleet Unit on any node in any cluster associated in the same <a href="https://github.com/OpenAperture/manager/blob/master/lib/manager/db/models/messaging/messaging_exchange.ex">MessagingExchange</a> as the Overseer</li> which has no instances running.								
			</ul>
			<p>SystemEvents may have one of the following severities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>error</li>
				<li>warning</li>
				<li>info</li>
				<li>debug</li>
