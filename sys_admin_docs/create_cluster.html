	  		OpenAperture is a free, open-source hybrid cloud management platform that delivers software quickly and consistently regardless of location or workload. This future-ready platform from Lexmark Enterprise Software provides a comprehensive management system to handle the six pillars of cloud management – provisioning, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, security and metering.

			<h2>Creating an CoreOS Cluster</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>OpenAperture designed to run on top of a set of <a href="https://coreos.com/using-coreos/clustering/">CoreOS clusters</a> via the Fleet daemon (HTTP and fleetctl tools).  If you're spinning up clusters in Amazon, There are <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-on-ec2.html">up-to-date AMIs</a> available in each region (make sure to review the <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/quickstart.html">cloud-init settings</a> before hand).  OpenAperture can run in other Cloud providers or in private data centers, as long as the CoreOS clusters are available.</p>
			<p>OpenAperture components are recommended to on a 3-node cluster at a minimum.  Depending on your usage, you may want to tweak the sizes and configurations of the node.  For example, all of the OpenAperture System Components are written in Elixir and have a much higher startup cost than, say, Ruby on Rails apps.</p>
			<p>It's important to realize that the CoreOS clusters, based on the release channel selected, will <a href="https://coreos.com/releases/">automatically upgrade</a> themselves to the latest version of CoreOS.  The OpenAperture components must be keep up-to-date with CoreOS to ensure compatibility.</p>
			<h2>Networking Between Clusters</h2>
			<p>The following considerations should be made when configuring CoreOS clusters for use with OpenAperture:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clusters running a <a href="./components.html">Management Assembly</a> will need to:
					<ul>
						<li>expose a port for HTTP traffic (HTTPS will need to be terminated at a Load Balancer)</li>
						<li>expose port 5432 to a Postgres instance</li>
						<li>expose ports for incoming and outgoing AMQP messages (this port is configurable in the MessagingBrokerConnectionOptions); by default these ports are 5672 and 15672</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Clusters running a <a href="./components.html">Build Assembly</a> will need to:
					<ul>
						<li>expose port 2375 between the Builder Assembly cluster and the docker build cluster</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Clusters running a <a href="./components.html">Deployment Assembly</a> will need to:
					<ul>
						<li>expose ports 4001 and 7002 between the Deployment Assembly cluster and any application clusters</li>
						<li>expose port 22 between the Deployment Assembly cluster and any application clusters</li>
					</ul>						
			</ul>
